# HAL
Hardware Abstraction Layer of TwinCAT fieldbus devices 

## Aim
This project aims to provide a TwinCAT 3 library to abstract fieldbus devices (currently only EtherCAT) in a way that they provide the user with sensible interfaces. It will separate between two major use cases where one focuses on the configuration/commissioning of these kind of devices and the other focuses on the operational needs.


## Documentation
